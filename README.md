Another try with IONIC :wink:

> To generate APK file I'm launching a script in my windows system

Here is a copy of my `set_path_android_java.bat` file
```
set ANDROID_HOME=E:\Android\Sdk\
set JAVA_HOME=C:\app\openjdk-1.8.0_x86_64
set PATH=%PATH%;%ANDROID_HOME%\tools;%ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools;%JAVA_HOME%\bin
```

So I'm using _OpenJDK_
